# Linux-dotfiles

This repository contains the various Linux application dotfiles I use on my personal Linux system. The dotfiles include configuration files for window managers and applications. Whilst this GitHub repository was created so that I can access my dotfiles whenever I install or reinstall a system, you are free to use them under the terms of an GNU 3.0 Public Licence.

Before using you should be aware that these files are often a work in progress and there are no guarantees that they will work for you.
